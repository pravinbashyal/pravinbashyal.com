# Negative Margins

- negative margins can impact adjascent element
- if a margin pulls an element X px up it pulls adjascent element X px up as well
- to nullify add magnitude of negative margin to opposite side
- wanted to add timestamp below header
- keeps pulling up
- figured that's what's happening

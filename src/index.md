# Hi, I'm Pravin
I am a frontend developer by profession who has got passion for javascript, typescript, testing, and reactjs and friends. I believe writing accessible, well tested and well documented components is the right way to write frontend application. I also love writing songs, singing them, photography and indoor gardening.  I would like to think myself as a constant learner than expert on anything. I am hoping to write down things that I learned, built and also my thoughts on different topics.

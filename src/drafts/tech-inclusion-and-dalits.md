# Tech inclusion and dalits

- the systematic oppression that occurs against dalits is unprecedented
- one of the most under represented group of people
- tech inclusion is particularly tricky for dalits(so called untouchable) because it is not easy to identify someone as dalits just from looks or the names.
- people are shamed to come out as dalits
- no tech umbrella company that are vocals
